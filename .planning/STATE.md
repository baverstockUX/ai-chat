# Project State

## Current Position

Phase: Phase 1 — Chat Foundation & Authentication (01)
Plan: 2/8 completed
Status: Executing
Last activity: 2026-02-10 — Completed 01-02-PLAN.md (Authentication System Implementation)

Progress: [██░░░░░░] 2/8 plans (25.0%)

## Performance Metrics

| Plan  | Duration | Tasks | Files |
|-------|----------|-------|-------|
| 01-01 | 4m 20s   | 2     | 13    |
| 01-02 | 4m 59s   | 3     | 17    |

## Decisions Made

1. **Use Google AI SDK instead of Anthropic** (01-01)
   - Rationale: Per user specification for Google Gemini

2. **UUID primary keys for all tables** (01-01)
   - Rationale: Better for distributed systems and prevents ID enumeration

3. **Cascade delete on foreign keys** (01-01)
   - Rationale: Ensures data integrity when users/conversations deleted

4. **Use JWT sessions instead of database sessions** (01-02)
   - Rationale: Reduces database load and better for edge deployments

5. **Use bcrypt-ts for Edge Runtime compatibility** (01-02)
   - Rationale: Native bcrypt doesn't work in edge environments

6. **Protect routes via middleware matcher** (01-02)
   - Rationale: Prevents auth bypass via URL manipulation

## Accumulated Context

**Foundation Established:**
- Next.js 16 with App Router and TypeScript
- Database schema: user, conversation, message tables
- User isolation enforced via foreign key constraints
- All core dependencies installed (AI SDK, Drizzle ORM, NextAuth v5, Tailwind CSS, Radix UI)

**Authentication System:**
- NextAuth v5 with credentials provider and JWT sessions
- Bcrypt password hashing (10 rounds) via bcrypt-ts
- User registration and login flows with server actions
- Route protection via middleware (matcher pattern)
- Comprehensive form validation (client + server side)
- Toast notifications with sonner for user feedback
- Database ready for migration (pending DATABASE_URL configuration)
